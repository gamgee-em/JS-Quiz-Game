## User Story

AS A USER I WANT the page to load quickly and smoothly
I WANT to be able to click on the start quiz button and receive a question
I EXPECT to be asked to answer questions related to JavaScript.
I WANT receive a new question and set of answers with each answer 
I WANT to receive a score I can record in a highscore list
SO THAT when I return to the site I try to beat my previous score and test my knowledge.
